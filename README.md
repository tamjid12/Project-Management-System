# Project-Management-System

**The Project Management System** is an extensive web-based application I developed during my internship at [CNS](https://site.cnsbd.com/index.html). It offers project monitoring and reporting features and allows users to register, create, update, and delete projects.
Here are the key functionalities of the Project Management System:

1. User registration with username, password, and email.
2. Authentication system that redirects anonymous users to the login page.
3. A tabular display of projects created during a specific period of time.
4. Functionality for authenticated users to create new projects.
5. Project owners have the ability to edit and delete their projects. They can also add optional project members to any project, up to a maximum of 5 members. Users can view projects of other project owners.
6. A REST API endpoint (`GET /api/v1/projects`) that returns all projects in JSON format.
7. Consumption of the REST API and display of its data on an HTML page.
8. The system includes client-side form validation using JavaScript.

This project allowed me to apply and enhance my skills in Java Spring Boot, Spring Security, JPA, and JavaScript during my time at [CNS](https://site.cnsbd.com/index.html). It exhibits my ability to develop effective and user-friendly online applications.
